### Nice to meet you! I'm Anthony.
I'm a Python developer looking to get into professional software development. I'm
looking to leverage my teaching experience and group leadership skills to facilitate
healthy teamwork and find a development mentor.

### Previously,
I worked at a learning center, but we thought of the place as a Learning
Laboratory--something about school wasn't quite working for everyone, and we wanted
to discover how to fix it. We didn't believe in rote solutions, though: each student
presented unique challenges, and we designed a similarly unique learning plan for
each.

The global education team constantly immersed themselves in cutting-edge research into
education and child developmental psychology and valued data- and metrics-driven
goals and curricula.

By assessing the student and speaking with them and their parents, we could identify the
root cause underlying the surface grade or behavorial symptoms and discover a learning
plan that they could believe in, which gave them the tools they needed to succeed long
after they left our center.

Something we always asked our students to do during our first conversation was list
what they liked doing, versus what they were good at, since these lists didn't always
agree with each other. This question always resonated with me, until the pandemic
gave me the opportunity to begin a new career path.

### Learning Python
I started learning Python casually November 2019, and started seriously
dedicating myself to coding and IT curricula October 2020, while developing my personal
projects on the side. I'm looking to bring my teaching, speaking, and investigative
experience to solve software development problems, and find mentors to guide my
development and leadership path.
