  I'm looking for varied and exciting projects that let me learn-by-doing while
  encouraging growth as a developer and as a leader.

  I'm currently a private instructor and studying Python developer looking to take
  my first steps into a career in coding!
  
  Previously, I developed curricula, led trainings, mentored instructors, and
  collaborated with the global education team as senior faculty at Axiom Learning.
